Heart Disease Prediction Model
Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based model designed to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on various health parameters. Using a dataset of clinical features, the model leverages a Random Forest Classifier to provide predictions with high accuracy.

Key Features
Predicts Heart Disease: The model classifies whether a patient has heart disease (target: 1) or does not have heart disease (target: 0).

High Accuracy: The model achieves an accuracy of 98-99% when tested on real data.

Outlier Handling: Outliers in the dataset are addressed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to improve model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: RandomizedSearchCV is used to fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

Comprehensive Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using confusion matrices, classification reports, and cross-validation.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains clinical attributes like age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and more. It includes a target variable (target) which indicates whether the patient has heart disease or not.

Example Data:

Age	Sex	Chest Pain Type (cp)	Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)	Cholesterol (chol)	Target
52	1	0	125	212	0
53	1	0	140	203	0
70	1	0	145	174	1
61	1	0	148	203	1
Project Structure
The project is divided into the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned, and outliers are handled.

Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the data using hyperparameter tuning.

Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

Individual Prediction: The model is tested with individual patient data to predict heart disease presence.

Results
The model was tested on both patients without heart disease and patients with heart disease. The results yielded an accuracy of approximately 98-99%, confirming the model's robust performance.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in the healthcare domain, specifically in predicting heart disease. The model provides a reliable tool for clinicians and healthcare professionals to assess the risk of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics.
